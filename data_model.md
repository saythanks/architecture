### Payable

### Accounts

Represents a pool of money held by a user or app with a balance, and which can be debited or credited. Very basic table now, but this is likely more extensible in the future.

| Type | Name | Notes |
|:--|:--|:--|
| UUID | id | PRIMARY |
| FLOAT | balance | *Not sure about this one. Would have to be updated transactionally. Which is more complexity.* |

### Statements

This represents period tallying of account balances, such that we can easily figure out account balances without having to sum the whole table.

| UUID | id | PRIMARY |
| UUID | account_id | FOREIGN |
| UUID | last_tx_id | FOREIGN (just in case)|
| FLOAT | balance ||
